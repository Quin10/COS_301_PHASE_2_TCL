\section{Temporary How To}

\subsection{sections as ".tex"}
Pleas use "\textbackslash input\{\textbackslash texPath/FILE.tex\}" to add new sections in the main document. I believe this will keep everything neat and easy to improve or update.

Save all the sections in the (tex) sub-directory.

\subsection{images}
Use "\textbackslash imgPath/FILENAME" as the path to add graphics elements.

Save all the images in the (images) sub-directory.
