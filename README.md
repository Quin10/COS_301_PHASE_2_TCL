### Repository Guidelines

Our diagrams should preferably be drawn in Draw.io  for a consistent look, however if you can achieve the same look using a different platform then you may go ahead. Using Draw.io, the diagrams can be exported as PNG images and then embedded in the document as follows: Put the PNG file in the `images` directory and paste the following code in the SRS, but replace *image_file_name* with the file name of the image in **without** the extension:

```latex
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{image_file_name}
\caption{Use Case Diagram for...}
\end{figure}
```
*Ensure that javascript is enabled when using [Draw.io](https://draw.io/)*
