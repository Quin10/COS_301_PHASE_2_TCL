# COS301 TCL Phase2 / resources

Save all the resources the "main.tex" will use here.

## Sections as ".tex"

-Save all the sections in the (tex) sub-directory.

-Pleas use "\input{\texPath/FILE.tex}" to add new sections in the main document. I believe this will keep everything neat and easy to improve or update.


## Images

-Save all the images in the (images) sub-directory.

-Use "\imgPath/FILENAME" as the path to add graphics elements.
